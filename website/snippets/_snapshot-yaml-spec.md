:::info Use the latest snapshot syntax

In [dbt Cloud "Latest""](/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks) or [dbt Core v1.9+](/docs/dbt-versions/core-upgrade/upgrading-to-v1.9), you can configure snapshots in YAML files using the updated syntax within your `snapshots/` directory (as defined by the [`snapshot-paths` config](/reference/project-configs/snapshot-paths)).  This syntax allows for faster, more efficient snapshot management.
