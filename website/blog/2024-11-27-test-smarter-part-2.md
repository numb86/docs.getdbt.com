üëã¬†Greetings, dbt‚Äôers! It‚Äôs Faith & Jerrie, back again to offer tactical advice on *where* to put tests in your pipeline.

In [our first post](/blog/test-smarter-not-harder) on refining testing best practices, we developed a prioritized list of data quality concerns. We also documented first steps for debugging each concern. This post will guide you on where specific tests should go in your data pipeline.

*Note that we are constructing this guidance based on how we [structure data at dbt Labs.](/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview#guide-structure-overview)* You may use a different modeling approach‚Äîthat‚Äôs okay! Translate our guidance to your data‚Äôs shape, and let us know in the comments section what modifications you made. 

First, here‚Äôs our opinions on where specific tests should go:

- Source tests should be fixable data quality concerns. See the [callout box below](#sources) for what we mean by ‚Äúfixable‚Äù.
- Staging tests should be business-focused anomalies specific to individual tables, such as accepted ranges or ensuring sequential values. In addition to these tests, your staging layer should clean up any nulls, duplicates, or outliers that you can‚Äôt fix in your source system. You generally don‚Äôt need to test your cleanup efforts.
- Intermediate and marts layer tests should be business-focused anomalies resulting specifically from joins or calculations.  You also may consider adding additional primary key and not null tests on columns where it‚Äôs especially important to protect the grain.

## Where should tests go in your pipeline?

![A horizontal, multicolored diagram that shows examples of where tests ought to be placed in a data pipeline.](/img/blog/2024-11-27-test-smarter-part-2/testing_pipeline.png)

This diagram above outlines where you might put specific data tests in your pipeline. Let‚Äôs expand on it and discuss where each type of data quality issue should be tested. 

### Sources

Tests applied to your sources should indicate *fixable-at-the-source-system* issues. If your source tests flag source system issues that aren‚Äôt fixable, remove the test and mitigate the problem in your staging layer instead. 

:::tip[What does fixable mean?]
We consider a "fixable-at-the-source-system" issue to be something that:

- You yourself can fix in the source system.
- You know the right person to fix it and have a good enough relationship with them that you know you can *get it fixed.*

You may have issues that can *technically* get fixed at the source, but it won't happen till the next planning cycle, or you need to develop better relationships to get the issue fixed, or something similar. This demands a more nuanced approach than we'll cover in this post. If you have thoughts on this type of situation, let us know!

:::

Here‚Äôs our recommendation for what tests belong on your sources. 

- Source freshness: testing data freshness for sources that are critical to your pipelines.
    - If any sources feed into any of the ‚Äútop 3‚Äù [priority categories](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/test-smarter-not-harder#how-to-prioritize-data-quality-concerns-in-your-pipeline) in our last post, use [`dbt source freshness`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/source-freshness) in your job execution commands and set the severity to `error`. That way, if source freshness fails, so does your job.
    - If none of your sources feed into high priority categories, set your source freshness severity to `warn` and add source freshness to your job execution commands. That way, you still get source freshness information but stale data won't fail your pipeline.
- Data hygiene: tests that are *fixable* in the source system (see our note above on ‚Äúfixability‚Äù).
    - Examples:
        - Duplicate customer records that can be deleted in the source system
        - Null records, such as a customer name or email address, that can be entered into the source system
        - Primary key testing where duplicates are removable in the source system

### Staging

In the staging layer, your models should be cleaning up or mitigating data issues that can't be fixed at the source. Your tests should be focused on business anomaly detection.

- Data cleanup and issue mitigation: Use our [best practices around staging layers](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/2-staging) to clean things up. Don‚Äôt add tests to your cleanup efforts. If you‚Äôre filtering out nulls in a column, adding a not_null test is repetitive!  üå∂Ô∏è
- Business-focused anomaly examples: these are data quality issues you *should* test for in your staging layer, because they fall outside of your business‚Äôs defined norms. These might be:
    - Values inside a single column that fall outside of an acceptable range. For example, a store selling a greater quantity of limited-edition items than they received in their stock delivery.
    - Values that should always be positive, are positive. This might look like a negative transaction amount that isn‚Äôt classified as a return. This failing test would then spur further investigation into the offending transaction.
    - An unexpected uptick in volume of a quantity column beyond a pre-defined percentage. This might look like a store‚Äôs customer volume spiking unexpectedly and outside of expected seasonal norms. This is an anomaly that could indicate a bug or modeling issue.
  
### Intermediate (if applicable)

In your intermediate layer, focus on data hygiene and anomaly tests for new columns. Don‚Äôt re-test passthrough columns from sources or staging. Here are some examples of tests you might put in your intermediate layer based on the use cases of intermediate models we [outline in this guide](/best-practices/how-we-structure/3-intermediate#intermediate-models).

- Intermediate models often re-grain models to prepare them for marts.
    - Add a primary key test to any re-grained models.
    - Additionally, consider adding a primary key test to models where the grain *has remained the same* but has been *enriched.* This helps future-proof your enriched models against future developers who may not be able to glean your intention from SQL alone.
- Intermediate models may perform a first set of joins or aggregations to reduce complexity in a final mart.
    - Add simple anomaly tests to verify the behavior of your sets of joins and aggregations. This may look like:
        - An [accepted_values](/reference/resource-properties/data-tests#accepted_values) test on a newly calculated categorical column.
        - A [mutually_exclusive_ranges](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils#mutually_exclusive_ranges-source) test on two columns whose values behave in relation to one another (ex: asserting age ranges do not overlap).
        - A [not_constant](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils#not_constant-source) test on a column whose value should be continually changing (ex: page view counts on website analytics).
- Intermediate models may isolate complex operations.
    - The anomaly tests we list above may suffice here.
    - You might also consider [unit testing](/docs/build/unit-tests) any particularly complex pieces of SQL logic.

### Marts

Marts layer testing will follow the same hygiene-or-anomaly pattern as staging and intermediate. Similar to your intermediate layer, you should focus your testing on net-new columns in your marts layer. This might look like:

- Unit tests: validate especially complex transformation logic. For example:
    - Calculating dates in a way that feeds into forecasting.
    - Customer segmentation logic, especially logic that has a lot of CASE-WHEN statements.
- Primary key tests: focus on where where your mart's granularity has changed from its staging/intermediate inputs.
    - Similar to the intermediate models above, you may also want to add primary key tests to models whose grain hasn‚Äôt changed, but have been enriched with other data. Primary key tests here communicate your intent.
- Business focused anomaly tests: focus on *new* calculated fields, such as:
    - Singular tests on high-priority, high-impact tables where you have a specific problem you want forewarning about.
        - This might be something like fuzzy matching logic to detect when the same person is making multiple emails to extend a free trial beyond its acceptable end date.
    - A test for calculated numerical fields that shouldn‚Äôt vary by more than certain percentage in a week.
    - A calculated ledger table that follows certain business rules, i.e. today‚Äôs running total of spend must always be greater than yesterday‚Äôs.

### CI/CD

All of the testing you‚Äôve applied in your different layers is the manual work of constructing your framework. CI/CD is where it gets automated. 

You should run a [slim CI](/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#run-only-modified-models-to-test-changes-slim-ci) to optimize your resource consumption. 

With CI/CD and your regular production runs, your testing framework can be on autopilot. üòé

If and when you encounter failures, consult your trusty testing framework doc you built in our [earlier post](/blog/test-smarter-not-harder).

### Advanced CI

In the early stages of your smarter testing journey, start with dbt Cloud‚Äôs built-in flags for [advanced CI](/docs/deploy/advanced-ci). In PRs with advanced CI enabled, dbt Cloud will flag what has been modified, added, or removed in the ‚Äúcompare changes‚Äù section. These three flags offer confidence and evidence that your changes are what you expect. Then, hand them off for peer review. Advanced CI helps jump start your colleague‚Äôs review of your work by bringing all of the implications of the change into one place. 

We consider usage of Advanced CI beyond the modified, added, or changed gut checks to be an advanced (heh) testing strategy, and look forward to hearing how you use it. 

## Wrapping it all up

Judicious data testing is like training for a marathon. It‚Äôs not productive to go run 20 miles a day and hope that you‚Äôll be marathon-ready and uninjured. Similarly, throwing data tests randomly at your data pipeline without careful thought is not going to tell you much about your data quality. 

Runners go into marathons with training plans. Analytics engineers who care about data quality approach the issue with a plan, too. 

As you try out some of the guidance above here, remember that your testing needs are going to evolve over time. Don‚Äôt be afraid to revise your original testing strategy. 

Let us know your thoughts on these strategies in the comments section. Try them out, and share your thoughts to help us refine them.
